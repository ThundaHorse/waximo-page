      <Typography>Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</Typography>
      <Typography>
        These Terms and Conditions shall be governed by and construed in
        accordance with applicable laws without regard to conflict of law
        provisions. In the event of any dispute arising out of or relating to
        these Terms, the parties agree to first attempt to resolve the dispute
        informally through negotiation.
      </Typography>
      <br />
      <Typography>
        If a resolution cannot be reached informally, any unresolved disputes
        shall be submitted to binding arbitration in a mutually agreed-upon
        location, conducted by a neutral arbitrator. The arbitration shall be
        conducted in English, and each party shall bear its own costs and
        expenses associated with the arbitration unless otherwise determined by
        the arbitrator.
      </Typography>
      <br />
      <Typography>
        Either party may seek temporary or preliminary injunctive relief from a
        court of competent jurisdiction if necessary to protect their rights or
        property pending the outcome of arbitration.
